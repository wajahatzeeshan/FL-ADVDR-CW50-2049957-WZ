Hands-on exercise 6: Building and scanning Docker images


Step 1: Build Alpine Image
In this step, you will pull the Alpine Docker image from Docker Hub. Run the following command in root folder(not the actual root, rather your username folder):


docker pull alpine

This will download the Alpine Docker image from Docker Hub.


Step 2: Run Clair Server
Before scanning Docker images with Clair, you need to start the Clair server. You can use Docker to run the Clair server in a container. Run the following commands to start the Clair server:

docker run -p 5433:5432 -d --name db arminc/clair-db:latest
docker run -p 6060:6060 --link db:postgres -d --name clair arminc/clair-local-scan:latest

This will start the Clair server on port 6060.


Step 3: Install Clair-Scanner
Next, you need to install Clair-scanner on your machine. You can do this by running the following command:

sudo curl -L https://github.com/arminc/clair-scanner/releases/download/v12/clair-scanner_linux_amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/clair-scanner
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/clair-scanner

This will download and install Clair-scanner on your machine.


Step 4: Find Your IP
You need to find the IP address of your machine to scan Docker images using Clair-scanner. Run the following command to find the docker0 IP address:

ifconfig docker0 | grep inet
Use inet network IP address.

If the ifconfig command is not found, you can install it with the following command:

sudo apt install net-tools




Step 5: Scan Alpine:latest Image
Now that you have started the Clair server and installed Clair-scanner, you can scan the Alpine Docker image using Clair-scanner. Run the following command:

clair-scanner --ip <your_ip_address> alpine:latest

Replace <your_ip_address> with the IP address of your machine that you found in the previous step.

This command will scan the Docker image with the name alpine and tag latest. The --ip option specifies the IP address of the machine running the scanner.


Step 6: Scan Myapp Image
In the previous hands-on lab, you built a Docker image named myapp. You can scan this Docker image using Clair-scanner as well. Run the following command:

clair-scanner --ip <your_ip_address> myapp:latest

Replace <your_ip_address> with the IP address of your machine that you found in Step 4.
This command will scan the myapp Docker image for vulnerabilities.


Congratulations!
You have successfully built and scanned Docker images using Clair scanner!
