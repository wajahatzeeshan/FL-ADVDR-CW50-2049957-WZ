Hands-on exercise 9: Implementing Docker monitoring and performance optimization


Step 1: Setting up a Monitoring Stack


To monitor Docker containers and hosts, we need to set up a monitoring stack. The monitoring stack consists of several components, including:
- Prometheus: A monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects metrics from targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints.
- Grafana: A dashboard and visualization platform that allows you to visualize and analyze metrics collected by Prometheus.
- cAdvisor: A container monitoring tool that collects metrics about containers running on a Docker host.

To set up the monitoring stack, follow these steps:


1. Create a new directory for the monitoring stack:

mkdir docker-monitoring
cd docker-monitoring


2. Once inside newly created folder, create a new file named docker-compose.yml with the following contents:

version: '3.7'   
services:   
  prometheus:   
    image: prom/prometheus:v2.28.1   
    container_name: prometheus   
    volumes:   
      - ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml   
    ports:   
      - 9090:9090   
  grafana:   
    image: grafana/grafana:8.2.2   
    container_name: grafana   
    ports:   
      - 3030:3000  
  cadvisor:   
    image: gcr.io/cadvisor/cadvisor  
    container_name: cadvisor   
    ports:   
      - 8080:8080   
    volumes:   
      - /:/rootfs:ro   
      - /var/run:/var/run:rw   
      - /sys:/sys:ro   
      - /var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro  



This file specifies the services we need for our monitoring stack: Prometheus, Grafana, and cAdvisor.


3. Create a new file named prometheus.yml with the following contents:

global:   
  scrape_interval: 5s   
scrape_configs:   
  - job_name: 'cadvisor'   
    static_configs:   
      - targets: ['cadvisor:8080']   


This file specifies the configuration for Prometheus. It tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from cAdvisor every 5 seconds.



4. Start the monitoring stack:

docker-compose up -d


This command starts all the services in the monitoring stack in detached mode.
After the services have started, you should be able to access Prometheus at http://localhost:9090 , Grafana at http://localhost:3030 and cAdvisor at http://localhost:8080


You can use port forwarding on GCP

Step 2: Access cAdvisor


Click on Change port and enter cAdvisor port number: 8080
